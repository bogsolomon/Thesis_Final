Assuming a network that looks like the one in Figure \ref{fig:aco_init} initially, where the load of the links is the value shown on the edges, and ants start at \textit{S} and end at \textit{E}. Assuming that there are 6 ants in the system, each ant deposits pheromone at a rate of $1.5/edge-load$, and that in the initial state ants have an equal chance of taking an edge as there are no pheromones deposited. After the first run of the ants the pheromone in the network will look as in figure \ref{fig:aco_pher}. In figure \ref{fig:aco_pher} the edges show the number of ants taking each edge and the total amount of pheromone deposited. When going back to the source, more ants will prefer edges with higher pheromone values thus resulting in that path being reinforced, while other paths will have the pheromone level decay. As more time passes, ants will continue to add more pheromone on good paths in the end resulting in the path with the lowest load being reinforced. If the load in the network changes, ants will be able to start reinforcing the path with the better performance and forget about the previous path.
